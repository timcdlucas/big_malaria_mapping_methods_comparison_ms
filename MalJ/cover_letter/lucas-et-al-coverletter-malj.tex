%	LETTER CONTENT

\opening{Dear Prof. Marcel Hommel,}

I am pleased to submit the article ``'' to be considered for publication in the Malaria Journal.
There are two files: the main manuscript (tim-lucas-model-compare.pdf), the supplementary code (tim-lucas-model-compare.zip) and the supplementary material (tim-lucas-model-compare-si.pdf).

Mapping of disease risk has been a core component of malaria epidemiology for decades and the methods developed for malaria epidemiology have been influential in the broader field of geostatistics.
The estimation of malaria risk allows us to calculate national level disease metrics such as incidence and prevalence and also allows for interventions to be targeted more optimally.
While methods for malaria mapping are continually being developed, the various models are rarely compared in a rigorous manner.
Furthermore, a fact neglected in epidemiology but well known in the predictive modelling community, is that a good covariate can often improve model performance more than a better model.
Again, the assessment of new covariates for malaria mapping is rarely done  in a general manner.

In this paper we have compared a large number of mapping methods and a large number of covariates to assess the predictive performance of both.
We use as our study system the mapping of malaria prevalence, annually between 2000 and 2018, at 5km resolution, across Africa.
We compare many state of the art modelling methods such as stacked generalisation, random fourier feature approximations to Gaussian processes, model based geostatistics and machine learning methods.
We also develop a number of new methods such as spatially varying model stacking and data fusion methods for combining mosquito, EIR and lymphatic filariasis data.
We also compare a range of newly collected or estimated covariates that hitherto have been rarely used in malaria mapping.
These covariates include housing quality, mosquito suitability, world bank indicators and new metrics of human movement.

We hope that this paper will act as a guide to the variety of mapping methods available, a benchmark against which future methods can be compared as well as the reference for the newly developed methods.


\closing{Yours sincerely,}
